# 0x01. AirBnB clone - Web static

> This repository contains the tasks for `AirBnB clone - Web static` project and a description of what each program or function does:

## Description:

This project is a follow up to the **AirBnB clone - The console project**. Having implemented the command interpreter, now itâ€™s time to go to the next step of building the front end step-by-step. 

With this project, I will design (sketch or prototype) each element by completing the following:
* Create simple HTML static pages
* Style guide
* Fake contents
* No Javascript
* No data loaded from anything

The project is aimed at learning how to manipulate HTML and CSS languages. HTML governs the web page-structure and therefore should should be the first thing to write while CSS helps to apply styling (the design) to the web page.
